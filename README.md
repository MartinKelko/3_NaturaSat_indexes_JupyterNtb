The provided Python script efficiently reads an Excel file containing required indexes - NDPI (Normalized Difference Pond Index), NDTI (Normalized Difference Turbidity Index), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) data, which has been processed by Naturasat software, into a pandas DataFrame. The script then visualizes this data using a bar chart with matplotlib. By setting the 'Curve_name' column as the index, the plot is clear and well-organized. The chart is customized with specific colors, titles, labels, and a grid for better readability and presentation. This approach allows for an intuitive visual analysis of the index statistics, facilitating easier interpretation of the data patterns and trends. This method can be a valuable tool for researchers and analysts working with environmental and geographical datasets processed by Naturasat software.

The NaturaSat software integrates various image processing techniques together with vegetation data, into one multipurpose tool that is designed for performing facilities for all requirements of habitat exploration, all in one place. It provides direct access to multispectral Sentinel-2 data provided by the European Space Agency. It supports using these data with various vegetation databases, in a user-friendly environment, for, e.g., vegetation scientists, fieldwork experts, and nature conservationists.
